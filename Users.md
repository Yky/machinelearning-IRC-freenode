# Who are we?

## Adding yourself
If you contribute to the channel, please consider private-messaging the user *pi-* (or *p-i-*) an introductory text about you for inclusion here. (Freestyle is ok.) Better yet, submit a pull request. It would be nice if we have some idea of who is who, who is up to what, etc. Tell us where you are based. Are you using ML for work or play? What do you use it for? Do you have a GitHub repo of interest?  Are you at a company or a university? Anything else you care to say?

## Staff
* **[brand0](https://github.com/brandonrobertz)** (Washington, USA; Independent researcher)  
  *ML interests:* character-level modeling, text clustering, outlier detection, application to journalism  
  I'm an independent researcher with professional experience in investigative journalism and publishing, machine learning, and full-stack development in the tech industry. Currently editing a zine exploring machine learning applied to journalism called [Artificial Informer](http://artificialinformer.com).

 * **[pasky](https://github.com/pasky)** (Prague, CZ)  
  *ML interests:* Deep architectures, attention models, transfer learning, practice rather than theory  
  In the past, I worked in academia and freelance on a variety of AI / machine learning problems. My main focus was Computer Go (my masters was one of the sort-of-AlphaGo-predecessor programs) and then NLP (question answering and related text understanding problems). Lately I do a lot of vision-like stuff - I co-founded an AI startup Rossum where we are reading invoices using neural networks. I'm a hardcore Keras fan.

* **[pi-](https://github.com/p-i-)** (Oxford, UK; Freelance coder)  
  *ML interests:* Primarily the theory. The new stuff as it comes out (GANs, VAEs, etc.), biologically plausible models (spiking neuron,...), coding in Julia.  
  *Relevant skills:* IPython / numpy, MATLAB, Julia  
  My background is coding, math, DSP. I'm trying to get myself up to speed with modern ML thinking & get a grip on the probabilistic math. I'm keeping an eye on Julia. My goal is to become a digital nomad working with ML.

 * **RandIter** (New York, USA; Software engineer)  
   *Relevant skills:* Python  
  I'm a backend software engineer in finance, having previously worked for many years in academia.  
  
  * **synja** (USA; Ontologist and automation programmer)
  
  * **warsh** (New York, USA; Student)  
  *ML interests:* FPGA acceleration of NN  
  *Relevant skills:* Python, C, Verilog  
  My interests lie more within the realm of theory. I'm focusing on improving the efficieny of neural networks by use of FPGAs.

## Users
* **[Henry_Jia](https://github.com/HenryJia)** (Axminster, UK; Student)  
  *ML Interests:* General deep learning for computer vision and more  
  *Relevent Skills:* C/C++, python, Theano/Keras, MatLab/GNU Octave  
  *Background:* I'm a student in a UK high school, and will be graduating to university soon. I also work remotely as a machine learning researcher/engineer for a Silicon Valley tech firm. In addition, I'm a part time Kaggler whenever a deep learning challenge pops up.
  
* **[jo_](https://github.com/josephcatrambone)** (California, USA; Researcher)  
  *ML Interests:* Generative Models, Production-Ready (End-User Distributable) Systems, Building ML Frameworks  
  *Relevant skills:* Python, Java, Kotlin, C, JavaScript, Rust  
  Started a PhD in ML.  Finished with an MS.  Not very good.  I'm interested in procedural content creation and generative machine learning models, particularly conversational chat bots and image generation.  I enjoy game development as a hobby and do my best to bring the two areas together whenever I can.

* **[rofer](https://github.com/rhofour)** (Pittsburgh, USA; Software engineer)  
  *ML Interests:* Sample-efficient Deep RL methods, variational methods, generative models  
  Ever since I left undergrad I've been trying to work towards a graduate level understanding of ML methods while working fulltime. Right now I'm particularly interested in improving the sample efficiency of Q-learning methods.
  
* **[unixpickle](https://github.com/unixpickle)**  
  *ML Interests:* meta-learning (specifically deep meta-learning); recurrent neural networks, including memory-augmented neural networks.  
  [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3XtGMELeTxytyFKrUu87EudAJiO4XK0u)  
  *Relevant Skills:* [Go](https://golang.org), Numerical Analysis, MATLAB/GNU Octave  
  *Background:* I am a long-time programmer who became interested in AI several years ago. Since then, I have been implementing my own ML software, including the [anynet](https://github.com/unixpickle/anynet) package for deep learning. Currently, I am trying to develop meta-learning techniques that can use prior experience to solve new problems as efficiently as humans.

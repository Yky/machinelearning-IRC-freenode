# Getting started
Proficiency in [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) is strongly recommended for practicing modern machine learning. While Python is used heavily for machine learning including deep learning, [R](https://www.r-project.org/) is popular among data scientists and statisticians. A best practice is to use a separate virtual environment using [`virtualenv`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv/) for each Python project. After mastering Python, here are some basic starter resources for applied machine learning:

## Videos
* [DeepLearning.TV YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjJh1vlSEYgvZ3ze_4pxKHNh1g5PId36-) -- 17 ~5-min vids, good starter -- introduces the main ideas at a non-technical level.
* [Andrew Ng's ML Coursera course](https://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=A89DCFA6ADACE599) -- best beginner course.
* [Nielsen -- Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) -- online book, recommended for beginners.
* [Hinton's Coursera course: Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks) (Youtube playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoRl3Ht4JOcdU872GhiYWf6jwrk_SNhz9)) -- gets pretty advanced, and much of the later material is fast becoming obsolete (RBM, WakeSleep, DBM, DBN). Nevertheless, Hinton is the single biggest contributor to modern ML, and it's worth persevering with.

## Education
It is beneficial to gain demonstrable education in machine learning and to develop a corresponding portfolio of projects. To this end, the following should be of strong interest:
* [Cousera Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning)
* [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

Refer to the [full list](https://www.coursera.org/browse/data-science/machine-learning?languages=en) of Coursera machine learning specializations.

## Books
<!--Free PDF books only-->
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)

## Misc
I haven't reviewed these yet (pi) but they look decent.

[fast.ai](http://course.fast.ai/lessons/lessons.html) -- Practical Deep Learning For Coders  
http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/ -- MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars  

At some point someone (probably me -- pi) needs to look through these links & figure out if they really belong here. We can't be handling list of links to a beginner. It has to be a clear learning path.
